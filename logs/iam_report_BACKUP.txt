        WARNING:
            iam:PassRole overly permissive
        EXPLANATION:
            Any IAM identity (i.e. users, groups, or roles) 
            with this policy can assign roles to an instance
            of any resource.
            
            As such, this policy can be exploited to grant
            unintended permissions to any resource.
            
            More info: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html
        RECOMMENDATION:
            If you want iam:PassRole to be permitted:
            - Specify resource ARNs explicitly in 'Resource'
            - Add the iam:PassedToService condition key to the statement
            
            If you do not want iam:PassRole to be permitted:
            - Specify iam actions explicitly in 'Action'
